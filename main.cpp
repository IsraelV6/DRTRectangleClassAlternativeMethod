//Alternative Method Dr_T Rectangle Class per Gaddis
//Fork off of this solution:
//https://repl.it/@TysonMcMillan/DRTRectangleClassAlternativeMethod
//method Definitions occur withing the class declaration
//A default constructor is written to inialize members
// A parameterized constructor is also shown
//Notice how this method is much more concise compared to scope resolution method

    Dr. T Challenge
    1) Expand the program to calculate the area of a Hexagon give that 
    Area of hexagon = (3âˆš3 s^2)/2
    2) Create a class Hexagon by the alternative method
    3) Accept input for a local int main() variable for side
    4) Calculate the area given input of the side. 
    5) via a void show() method member of the Hexagon class, 
     Draw the hexigon on screen with star patterns: given this cool example: 
    https://www.sololearn.com/compiler-playground/cVzNeFm1fapB/#cpp
    6) Change the color of the hexigon to a color or colors of your choice. 
    7) Loop the hexigon program unitl -1 is provided for input
     Set -2 as the option to clear the screen.
